This project uses Docker containers with ImageMagick and other libraries installed.

Put your files in ./input.  Run `make build`.  Run `make c_image` to open a terminal in the container.

In the terminal, run things like `pngcrush input_image.png /output/image_min.png` to output a minimized version to ./output.
